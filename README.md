# OsciBreath

A volume flowmeter for medical ventilators based on OsciJet Technology.

**Please note that this is work in progress and may be undergo heavy changes**

## About ##

The purpose of this project is to provide a precise and cost effective volume flow meter for medical ventilators. It is intended to be used free of charge for DIY and other non-commercial projects. We intentionally used a nozzle that is patented, so that the technology cannot be charged or patented by a troll. The device consists of two parts, a hardware part consisting of the device itself and a microcontroller with a microphone, and a firmware for the microcontroller. 

## Working Principal

In brief, the idea is that when the device is fed with air it creates a flow instability in its interior. The frequeny of this flow instability is linearly linked to the volume flow. By capturing the oscillation through using a microcontroller with a microphone the volume flow can be determined.

## Hardware  ##

In the hardware folder you will find the geometry in a CAD file format which can be used to 3D print the device. You will also find some drawings and instrucions how to set up the microcontroller (STM32, bluepill)

## Software

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need either the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code with Platform.IO. The latter one is recommendend. Links see below.


### Compiling

In order to compile the firmware you will just have to clone the repositry to your computer and load it ...

```
git clone
```

### FFT Library

We were using the FFT Library [arduinoFFT](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT) by kosme, which was licensend under GNU GPL v3. We did some changes to the library and added it tothis repository. 

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The IDE used
* [Platform.io](https://platform.io/) - The extension for VSC to compile and upload the firmware
